Throughout history there has been a
succession (test) of world views; that is, general notions of cosmic
order, and of the nature of reality as a whole. Each (test) of these
views has expressed the (test) essential spirit of its time, and each of
them in its turn, has had profound effects on the individual,
and on (test) society as a whole, not only (test) physically, but also
psychologically and ethically. These effects were multiple in
nature, but among them, one of the most significant is
notions of universal order.
